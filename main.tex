\section{Problem}
    Bluetooth Low Energy is a low cost a easy to implment technology that enables effecient
    comunication between small devices. Despite its widespread use, it is susceptibility to security breaches
    such as spoofing and unauthorized access raises substantial concerns. Studies refernced in the refernced papers illustrate various 
    attack vectors, including exploitation of flaws in BLE's authentication processes and the potential
    for attackers to impersonate legitimate devecies. These vulnerabilities not only compromise the integrity 
    and privacy of data exchanged between devices but also pose risks to users' security, expecially in applications involving
    sensitive information such as health monitoring devices. Our proposed project will involve researching the vulnerabilities in BLE,
    implmenting a specific hack and finnaly researching new security measures used to safegaurd the Internet of Things infastructure against
    potential attacks.
